> Composite of 70 images showing sAC in the sinus venosus from a larger hagfish; the boxed areas are shown at higher magnification in i–v. In the higher-magnification images, the left panels are differential interference contrast, and the scale bars represent 50 µm. sAC immunostaining is in red; nuclei are stained in blue.
