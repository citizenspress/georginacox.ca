title: "Cardiovascular function in response to environmental anoxia"
summary: "The vast majority of vertebrates can survive only minutes when cut off from oxygen, but some have physiological and biochemical adaptations that allow long term survival in anoxic environments."

Climate warming is leading to the creation and expansion of areas of reduced dissolved oxygen in the marine environment, termed  "oceanic dead zones". As surviving in oxygen limited environments is a challenge for most marine species, the spectacular anoxia (no oxygen) tolerance of the phylogenetically ancient hagfish is particularly interesting and relevant for predicting species persistence in areas that will likely experience reduced environmental oxygen. In this set of studies I discovered, not only that hagfish could persist in anoxia for >36 hr, but I also uncovered a number of diverse cardiovascular and biochemical phenotypes that permit survival in anoxia. These findings  provide new insight into cardiovascular function, which has been traditionally viewed as a highly aerobic process."
