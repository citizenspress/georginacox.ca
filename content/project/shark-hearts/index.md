title: "Form, Function, and Evolution of the Coronary Artery"
summary: "In this set of studies, I use sharks as a model system to study the functional significance of the cardiac oxygen supply. Sharks are ideal model species as they are the most ancient vertebrates to possess a coronary artery and, like mammals, have fully vascularized hearts."
